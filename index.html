    <h1>How I wish you were here</h1>
    <div class="text">
      <div class="verse-1">
        <p>So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, Blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="verse-2">
        <p>Did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange A walk on part in the war, For a lead role in a cage?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="verse-3">
        <p>How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl, Year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found The same old fears. Wish you were here.</p>
